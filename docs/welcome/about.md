# About This Textbook

This textbook represents a modern approach to learning Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, combining theoretical foundations with practical implementation.

## Pedagogical Approach

Our methodology emphasizes:

- **Theory-Practice Integration**: Each concept is paired with hands-on exercises
- **Progressive Complexity**: Concepts build upon each other from basic to advanced
- **Real-World Applications**: Examples drawn from current research and industry
- **Interactive Learning**: Built-in assessments and practical exercises

## Learning Structure

The textbook is organized into four interconnected modules:

1. **Foundation**: ROS 2 architecture and basic robot programming
2. **Simulation**: Digital twin creation and physics modeling
3. **AI Integration**: Advanced perception and planning systems
4. **Cognitive Systems**: LLM integration and multimodal interaction

## Assessment Methodology

Each module includes:
- Knowledge checks throughout chapters
- Practical exercises with code examples
- Comprehensive assessments at module end
- Capstone project in Module 4

## Technical Stack

This textbook covers the following technologies:
- **ROS 2**: Robot Operating System for communication and control
- **Gazebo/Unity**: Physics simulation and visualization
- **NVIDIA Isaac**: AI-powered robotics platform
- **Python**: Primary programming language for examples
- **Docker**: Environment standardization
