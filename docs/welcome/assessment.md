# Assessment Guidelines

This textbook includes multiple assessment methods to ensure comprehensive learning and understanding of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics concepts.

## Assessment Structure

Each module includes:

- **Knowledge Checks**: Embedded throughout chapters
- **Practical Exercises**: Hands-on implementation tasks
- **Module Assessments**: Comprehensive end-of-module evaluations
- **Capstone Project**: Integrated application in Module 4

## Grading Criteria

### Knowledge Checks (Formative Assessment)
- **Purpose**: Immediate feedback during learning
- **Format**: Multiple choice, short answer
- **Feedback**: Immediate with explanations
- **Passing Score**: Not required, for self-assessment

### Practical Exercises (Competency-Based)
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate practical skills
- **Format**: Step-by-step implementation tasks
- **Feedback**: Detailed solution walkthroughs
- **Passing Score**: 80% completion with correct implementation

### Module Assessments (Summative)
- **Purpose**: Evaluate comprehensive understanding
- **Format**: Mixed question types (MCQ, short answer, code analysis)
- **Feedback**: Detailed explanations for all answers
- **Passing Score**: 75% for progression

### Capstone Project (Integration)
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate integrated knowledge
- **Format**: Complex, multi-component implementation
- **Feedback**: Peer and instructor review
- **Passing Score**: 85% for completion

## Assessment Methodology

### Self-Assessment Features
- Immediate feedback on all questions
- Detailed explanations for correct and incorrect answers
- Progress tracking through the textbook
- Performance analytics dashboard

### Adaptive Learning
- Difficulty adjusts based on performance
- Additional resources for struggling concepts
- Accelerated paths for mastered concepts

## Academic Integrity

All assessments should be completed independently to ensure genuine learning. Collaboration is encouraged for understanding concepts, but individual assessment work must be your own.

## Accessibility Accommodations

- Extended time options for assessments
- Alternative format availability
- Screen reader compatible interfaces
- Keyboard navigation support

## Assessment Schedule

- **Module 1**: Available after completing all chapters
- **Module 2**: Available after completing all chapters
