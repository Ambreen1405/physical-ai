# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics! This interactive learning resource is designed to take you from foundational concepts to advanced applications in the field of embodied artificial intelligence.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the fundamental principles of Physical AI
- Learn about the architecture of modern humanoid robotics systems
- Explore the integration of AI with physical systems
- Gain practical experience with ROS 2, simulation environments, and AI frameworks

## About This Textbook

This textbook is structured into four progressive modules that build upon each other:

1. **Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals** - Learn the foundation of robot operating systems
2. **Module 2: The Digital Twin** - Explore simulation environments (Gazebo & Unity)
3. **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain** - Master NVIDIA Isaac platform
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action Systems** - Integrate LLMs with robotics

Each module contains theoretical concepts, practical exercises, and assessments to ensure comprehensive learning.
